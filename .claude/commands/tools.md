# List Built-in Tools

Provide a structured list of all core, built-in development tools supported by the current runtime environment.

## Guidelines

- Include only **native tools** (exclude third-party plugins, extensions, or MCP-provided tools)
- Clearly describe each tool’s **purpose and capabilities**
- Represent tool interfaces using a **language-agnostic function signature**
- If applicable, include optional parameters and constraints

## Output Format

- Bullet list
- Each tool represented as a function-style signature
- Avoid assumptions about the host framework or AI provider
